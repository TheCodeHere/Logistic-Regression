# Logistic-Regression
Simple Logistic Regression code made from scratch in python 3.0, showing the gradient descent version and their respective version with and without regularization. The code will show, in each of the versions, the behaviour if the cost function and the decision boundary obtained from the model at the end of the training. It's use an external dataset (e.g. "logReg_data.txt"). In this case, two-dimensional dataset were used.
